    #    Setting this value too long could mean that the traffic could be routed to the instance even
    #    though the instance is not alive. Setting this value too small could mean, the instance may be taken out of traffic

    #    Indicates how often (in seconds) the eureka client needs to send heartbeats to eureka server to indicate that
    #    it is still alive. If the heartbeats are not received for the period specified in leaseExpirationDurationInSeconds,
    #    eureka server will remove the instance from its view, there by disallowing traffic to this instance.

    #    Note that the instance could still not take traffic if it implements HealthCheckCallback
    #    and then decides to make itself unavailable.
